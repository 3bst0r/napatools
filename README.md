===================================================================
Master Thesis by Johannes A. Ebster

The source code in this forked open source project has been modified and extended as part of Johannes Ebster's Master Thesis.
The code under `experiment-runner/` is the work of Johannes Ebster and is used to run benchmark experiments given an experiment configuration file. 
The rest of the code was copied and/or modified and/or extended from the upstream open source repository. It was used to transfer the test data from Couchbase Server to MongoDB, ArangoDB and PostgreSQL.

The publicly available fork is at https://github.com/3bst0r/napatools/tree/nosql-indexing-in-practice.
